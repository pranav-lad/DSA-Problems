Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4


Code : 

class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int l=0;
        int mid,h = nums.size()-1;
        while(l<=h){
            mid = (l+h)/2;
            if(nums[mid]== target){
                return mid;
            }
            else if(nums[mid] < target){
                l = mid+1;
            }
            else{
                h = mid-1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
